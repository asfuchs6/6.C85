    <h2>Proposition: Increasing access to abortion clinics in states increases the amount of abortions that happen.
        Likewise, decreasing access to abortion clinics in states decreases the amount of abortions that happen.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/pro.png" width="800" height="600" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                This visualization shows the change in abortion rates compared to the change in the amount of abortion
                clinics from 2017-2020.
                Each data point represents a different state. Data points in the upper right quadrant represent and
                increased change in the number of abortion clinics
                and an increased amount of abortion cases. The upper left corner represents and increase in abortion
                clinics and a decrease in the amount of abortions.
                The bottom left quadrant represents states that decreased the amount of clinics and had a decrease
                amount of abortion cases. The bottom right quadrant
                represents a decreased amount of abortion clinics but an increase in abortion cases per state. This
                visualization strongly supports the proposition that
                an increase in abortion clinics increases the amount of abortion cases since there are more data points
                in the upper right quadrant than the upper left.
                Similarly, a decrease in abortion clinics reduces the amount of abortion cases which is proven by the
                majority of data points in the lower half of the graph are in the left quadrant
                and not the right.
                Note: Tableau would not let me expand the width of the legend/keys more than I have it in this visual.
                The values cut off should say 2017-2020. If I were able to I would expand the legend box or I would
                format the text on two separate lines.

        <p>
            Design Decisions and Rationale:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Trendline: Trendlines immediately jump out to the viewer and make them see a trend without having to do
                any work.
                If the line looks like it makes sense, they will not try to calculate it to make sure that it is
                actually representative of the data.
                Therefore, I wanted to further increase the slope in the positive direction to support the proposition
                and have a stronger visual effect.
                However, since Tableau would not let me adjust the slope calculation, I found a work around (see next
                bullet point). Deception Score: -.5.
                Since the trendline is accurate, I was originally going to score it a 2. However, my intention is to
                make the viewers just rely on their visual instincts without further investigating
                the presented data so I would say that the line leans towards deceptive.
            </li>
            <li>Axis Dimensions: In order to create a larger visual effect of data points being in the upper right
                quadrant, I decided to shrink the X-axis.
                Both the Y and X axis' range are from -100 to 100 so viewers who are quickly looking may think they are
                proportionate.
                But in fact, the X-axis is slightly smaller so the data looks more condensed. Even if viewers look at
                the gridlines, I only changed the proportion enough so that it isn't
                immediately obvious that the Y-axis is slightly longer. This is similar to the effect we saw in lecture:
                If 2 identical visuals only slightly vary from each other, viewers
                will take longer and have more difficulty discerning the difference than if the differences were larger.
                Deception Score: -2.
            </li>
            <li>Colors: I used 3-step coloring to highlight the '% change in the number of abortion clinics, 2017-2020.'
                I chose red because it grabs the viewers attention.
                Since it is a gradient, pink to dark red, viewers will naturally move their eyes in that direction (in
                this case upwards) which will make them further believe the proposition.
                Further, if you look at the visual for a longer time, the pink circles will fade compared to the darkly
                colored circles, which will create the illusion that all of the
                data is in the top half of the graph. Deception score: -1.
            </li>
            <li>Scatter Plot Graph: This graph is very intuitive for users to understand. Granted the data itself is not
                deceptive, the presentation is very straightforward.
                Many viewers will feel comfortable looking at this chart and so would trust what is presented to them
                and their intuition.
                Deception Score: 2.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
            <p>
                <h5>Visual 1</h5>
                <img src="images/out_of_state.png" width="700" height="350" alt=""/>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h5>Visual 2</h5>
            <img src="images/change_clinics.png" width="700" height="350" alt=""/>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Visual 3</h5>
                <img src="images/change_abortions.png" width="700" height="350" alt=""/>
            </p>

            <figcaption>
                Visual 1: Represents % of residents obtaining abortions out of state in 2020.
                Visual 2: Represents the % change in abortion clinics from 2017-2020.
                Visual 3: Shows the % change of abortions occuring in each state in from 2017-2020.
                Visual 1 and 2 show that states that decrease the amount of abortion clinics still have many women receiving abortion care,
                just outside their state borders. It is evident when you look at the midwest and southern states. The strongest removal of abortion care correlates
                with the highest amount of women leaving to get care elsewhere.
                This disproves the proposition that decreasing abortion care decreases the amount of abortions that happen.
                A similar trend appears if you compare Visual 2 with Visual 3: It is clear that even though southern states have largely reduced the amount of abortion care in their states,
                there are many states that have increased the amount of abortions that have happened.
                Note: Tableau would not let me expand the width of the legend/keys more than I have it in this visual.

                <ul>
                    Completed legend title:
                    <li>Visual 1: "% Change In The No. Of Abortion Clinics, 2017-2020."</li>
                    <li>Visual 2:% "Of Residents Obtaining Abortions Who Traveled Out Of State For Care, 2020."</li>
                </ul>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Design Decisions and Rationale:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Map Graph: I chose to use a map since all of my data was pertaining to each state and it is easy to visualize in this format.
                Viewers can easily see the data for each state and notice trends across different regions. Deception Score: 2.
            </li>
            <li>Colors: I chose to use orange to blue as my scale where orange represented negative values, and blue represented positive values. Since orange
            and blue are complimentary colors they are easy to differentiate and point out the disparity in values between states. In Visual 1, the dark blues draw the
            viewers attention and force the viewers to take interest in this region. Then when they look at Visual 2, they naturally will be drawn to the strong orange, but
            also because it is in a region of significance based on Visual 1. The same pattern follows for Visual 3. The choice of using color in this way primes the
            viewer to look at what I want them to and keep it in mind for the rest of their analysis. Using grey makes users ignores states that aren't relevant. Deceptive Score: -1.</li>
            <li>3 Different Graphs: Initially I planned to use a mix of different graph types, but realized that the consistency of the same graph type, in this case,
            would be more powerful. Viewers know what to expect in each visual and so will seamlessly transition between visuals. Ideally I could have overlapped the
            visuals or had a button that would allow users to switch the metrics, but this method of stacking visuals and scrolling between them still works. A benefit of
            this method is that it can be difficult for users to compare each state 1 to 1 as they have to look back and forth. This gives me, the designer, the benefit of
            generalizing groups of states without the user being able to equally notice any oversight in my analysis. Deception Score: -.5.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            While I was able to design visualizations that strongly supported or rejected the proposition, as the
            designer, it was quite difficult to create visualizations from the same dataset that would draw opposite conclusions.
            Besides tampering with the data, changing values or excluding values, I wanted to challenge myself to creatively be ~deceptive~.
            I realized the best way to do this would be to try and minimally change features so that it would only subconsciously guide the viewer's opinions
            and how they analyzed my visualizations. Something that surprised me was how I would sometimes mislead myself by not checking the default color scale that
            Tableau would set. While comparing two different data groups, I would miss that the range of values were not equivalent which would misguide my interpretation
            of the values. After this assignment, I now define ethical analysis and visualizations if they do not have any misleading features or tampering with the data.
            Since it is very difficult to remove any biases, I think ethical analysis is when the designer addresses any potential biases they might have and provides contexts
            that both support or challenge their design (as there is likely multiple sides to each dataset story).
            This feels the most transparent and ethical because it provides the most context to viewers to make the most informed interpretations.
            Going forward I will try to analyze visualizations by looking at all the key elements: title, axis titles and values, legends, data visualization choice, and then annotations.
            These will likely contain any misleading features. If the actual dataset has been manipulated it will be much harder to tell that the visualization is misleading.
            Acceptable persuasive choices would depend on the context and what the goal of the designer is. For example, I think that Simon Scarr's "Iraq's Bloody Toll"
            necessitates strong, visceral graphics because of how important and dark the subject is. I don't think it would be appropriate to create persuasive
            visuals when the intention is to mislead people at their own detriment (aka: spreading false covid information).

            Challenges with the dataset:
        <ul>
            <li>One challenge with data regarding abortions is that there is a lot of estimations that happen. Since
                there are states that strongly oppose women having abortions or make it very difficult to access,
                many women have to find alternative ways to get the care they need. This means they may not report that
                they have gone through an abortion which causes the data to be an underestimation
                of how many abortions really happen.
            </li>
            <li>Any data pertaining to 2014 uses the language "abortion provider", whereas any data regarding 2017
                onwards uses "abortion clinics."
                My intuition is that this dataset might have used different language when collecting this information
                from the different years/ different sources
                but I could also interpret the different wording to mean that the clinics represent facilites and
                providers represent doctors.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is hard to make comparisons across 2014-2020 and there is data just for 2014-2017, but not and equivalent dateset fo 2017-2020.
                This made it difficult to explore some of the data and the comparisons I wanted to.
            </li>
            <li>The metadata is not very clear. There are many notes but they do not explicitly explain to which dataset
                they are referring to, or whether they are meant to be general notes.
                It would have been helpful if the metadata explained which data sources provided which information. THis
                would have made it very easy for me to look up the exact source I need to address any questions I have
                instead of having to dig through 8 different sources.
            </li>
        </ul>

        Lastly, I would be interested to see new trends that have happened since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. Specifically,
        in data sets that also include the demographic of women receiving abortions, what their income is, and if there were any repercussions in doing so.
        It would be very powerful to see how damaging the impacts of this decision have been especially for women of color and women in lower income brackets.
